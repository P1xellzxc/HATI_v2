## 🎨 Design System: Manga x Notion

HATI² features a unique visual language that combines the bold, high-contrast energy of Shonen Manga with the clean, minimalist utility of Notion.

- **Manga Elements**: Heavy black borders (`MangaBlack`), hard shadows, sharp corners, and high-impact typography.
- **Notion Palette**: Soft, pastel category colors (`NotionYellow`, `NotionBlue`, `NotionRed`, `NotionGreen`, `NotionPurple`) for high readability.
- **Antigravity Experience**: Micro-animations and responsive layouts that keep the interface feeling light and "alive."

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dashboard "Hubs"** — Manage multiple "Volumes" (dashboards) for different travel arcs, households, or events.
- **Advanced Debt Calculation** — Automated split logic with "Settle Up" history and real-time dashboard stats.
- **Unified UI Architecture** — Standardized components (`MangaCard`, `TransactionCard`, `MangaTextField`) ensured across all screens for a seamless experience.
- **Performance Optimized** — Smooth scrolling and stable recompositions using efficient state management.
- **100% Offline-First** — Local data persistence with Room. Your data stays on your device.
