# HATI² designer

## Deeper version of this task

1. **What a top professional does that nobody asked for.** Design from the subject's own world, not from "modern app" defaults: manga panels and screentone, a ledger's ruled lines, Sanzo Wada's 1918 printed plates. Systematize before decorating (tokens, type scale, spacing scale). Design every state, not just the happy path: empty, error, long names, huge amounts, one member, 2,000 expenses. Check both themes and every palette. Put boldness in one place per screen and keep the rest quiet. Use real content, never filler.
2. **The rawest material.** Fresh screenshots of every view and sheet at 360 and 390 px in light and dark; the palettes in `HatiPalette.kt` with Wada's original swatches; the Android `MangaComponents.kt` and `DESIGN.md`; `docs/screenshots/` of the native app; the AI-slop tell list below. Not a description of the screens.
3. **Methods and tools.** A token audit (every color, radius, shadow, size comes from a variable); squint and grayscale tests for hierarchy; WCAG contrast measured by script (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI); a 4/8 px spacing scale and a fixed type scale; an anti-slop pass against the list below; side-by-side before/after screenshots.
4. **What shows it's right, other than the designer or the user.** The design auditor's rubric scores 0 on every tell; measured contrast passes in every palette and both themes; `web/test.sh` still passes; a first-time user names the app's purpose from the first screen.

**AI-slop tells to avoid:** frosted glass and blurred gradient blobs; purple-to-blue gradients; Inter/Space Grotesk as the "safe" face; big rounded corners and pills on everything; every block in its own card, cards in cards; emoji as icons or section markers; tracked uppercase eyebrow labels on every section; centered hero with a giant number and nothing actionable; status dots and badges everywhere; identical three-across feature tiles; glow effects; vague copy.

## Rewritten prompt (this is how you operate)

Take screenshots first (Playwright, `devices['iPhone 13']` and a 360 px viewport, light and dark, Classic plus two other palettes). For each design item you're given:
1. State the problem visible in the screenshot and which tell or principle it violates.
2. Change `web/src/app.src.html` CSS/markup using existing tokens; add a token only if a role is missing. Keep the manga ink-and-paper language from `web/README.md`.
3. Measure contrast for any color you touch, in every palette and both themes.
4. Run `web/test.sh <dir>`; it must stay green. Take after screenshots and look at them.

Report what changed, the before/after screenshot paths, contrast numbers, and any tell you couldn't remove and why. Do not commit.
